# Data-Visualization
Lab 1: Create new measures on a given dataset and visualize them using a bar graph

a)The United Nations (UN) wants to know what Countries are suffering more deaths due to Covid-19, in order to donate additional vaccines and prevent the spread of Covid, from the additional funds and vaccine budget of this month.

b)Find out what are the top 10 Countries suffering severely due to covid in the past month eligible for additional vaccine donations.

c)Need for vaccines and funding are estimated from the number of deaths in the past month

Lab 2: Perform time series aggregation, apply filters on a given dataset, create line and area charts.

Dataset:1

a)Vaccination in the USA started in full swing in Early Jan 2021. Analyze the trend of Cases per day from Jan 2021 (Vaccines begun) to the current day and report if this policy was useful

b)The USA implemented a policy where Vaccinated Individuals could avoid wearing masks in public from June 2021. The UN wants to view the impact of making such a move in the long term as well as the short term. 

c)Analysis requires the creation of a calculated field in terms of Cases Per day and a Weekly moving average of cases per day

d)Justify why you have chosen a particular visualizationfor this dataset.Also discuss the details of your visualization.

Dataset:2 Creditcard.csv from Kaggle
a)Using appropriate visualizationfind out the dates when credit card fraud had taken place.

b)Justify why you have chosen a particular visualizationfor this dataset. Also discuss the details of your visualization.

Lab 3: Apply maps, scatter plots on a given dataset and create a dashboard

a)The United Nations wants you to build a dashboard containing an overview of the vaccination progress, specifically 1+ doses and Fully vaccinated individuals, as a percentage of population vaccinated. 
b)The Covax vaccine scheme was used to supply vaccines topoorer countries like Africa. Has the scheme proven to be effective? -https://www.bbc.com/news/56100076

c)Use Maps to visualize the number of people vaccinated per 100 population to visualize the countries and regions in dire need of vaccines. It should be noted that the data only covers WHO approved vaccines.

d)Build a scatter plot to view the trend between 1+ Dose vaccinated and Fully vaccinated population, so the UN can advise countries that deviate from the recommended values to focus on getting a higher percentage of population fully vaccinated, or vice versa. 

e)The Dashboard should allow vaccine monitoring and filtering via WHO regions, allowing filtering for multiple regions.

Lab 4: Perform joins, blends and create dual axis charts

a)The company wants to analyze region wise return of productsfrom superstore dataset. Is there any relationshipof return of product with the discounts offered on it?

 b)Compare the region wise profits of superstoreand coffeechain(Market means region). Find which region has performed well for both. 

c)Show sales and profit together for both the datasetschoosing an appropriate visualization.

 d)Analyze year wise profit for both the datasets and illustrate the limitations of blendin

Lab 5:

The UN also has an Advisory Role. It advisescountries on things that require improvement/change. Use aHighlight table to find if any of the countries with a largepopulation require changes.The Highlight table would be used to compare the parameters withother countries in order to evaluate if anomalies are present.Health and/or Development Metrics should be used for the same

Lab 6: Create an interactive data story

Lab 7:  Perform Data cleaning on a given dataset

Lab 8: 

1.Consider a randomly generated dataset which has id, group number (1-10) and Values as three attributes. Implement systematic sampling, stratified sampling (3 stratas) and Cluster sampling.

2.Consider titanic dataset and implement strata sampling and cluster samplin

Lab 9:

1.Randomly generate a small dataset and show dimensionality reduction using PCA by writing the code from scratchin python.

2.Implement above code and reduce the dimensionsof IRIS dataset from 4 attribute to 2 attributes.

3.Use PCA code from sklearn.decomposition library and perform compressionon yourimage.

4.Use PCA code from sklearn.decomposition library and perform dimensionalityreduction on olivetti_face datase
